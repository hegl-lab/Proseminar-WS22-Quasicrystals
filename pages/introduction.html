        A tiling is a set of geometric shapes, called tiles, that are arranged
        in such a way to fill a plane without gaps or overlaps. A tiling can be
        periodic or non- periodic. Periodic tilings are constructed with a
        repeating pattern - the tiling has translational symmetry. The different
        types of tiles that make up a tiling are called the prototiles of that
        tiling. A tiling may be constructed using one or many prototiles.

        <h2 class="text-2xl">Periodic Tilings</h2>
        <p class="text-justify">
          The simplest tilings are constructed using regular polygons as the
          single prototile. There are only three possible regular polygon
          tilings: made of equilateral triangles, squares or regular hexagons.
          These have three–, four–, and six–fold rotational symmetry
          respectively. It is not possible to tile a plane with pen- tagons,
          because the internal angle of a pentagon, 108°, is not a divisor of
          360°. The same restriction applies to n > 6–sided polygons.

      <h2 class="text-2xl">Quasiperiodic tilings</h2>
      <p class="text-justify">
        subset of non-periodic tilings are quasiperiodic tilings. Although these
        tilings are not periodic, every finite region within the tiling
        reappears infinitely many times. Some quasiperiodic tilings also exhibit
        forbidden orders of rota- tional symmetry. The concept of quasiperiodic
        tilings have been of interest to physicists as a mathematical model of
        quasicrystals (QCs) since their discovery in 1982 by Dan Shechtman [1].
        This discovery was made following observations of a rapidly cooled
        aluminium-manganese alloy through an electron microscope. QCs are
        structures that possess long-range order, but not translational
        symmetry. The atomic structures of QCs are associated with quasiperiodic
        tilings. The QC discovered by Shechtman possesses fivefold symmetry, and
        other QCs have been found to possess other forbidden symmetries. These
        materials are typically synthesised in the laboratory. Following
        analysis conducted in 2009 by Paul Steinhardt on a Siberian meteorite
        sample [2] the first natural QC, icosahedrite, was found. The golden
        ratio, τ, is intrinsically linked to many of the tilings discussed in
        this report. This irrational number appears when the ratio of two
        quantities is equal to the ratio of their sum and the larger value.
        Expressed algebraically: $$\tau = \cfrac{a+b}{a}+
        \cfrac{a}{b}=\cfrac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$
